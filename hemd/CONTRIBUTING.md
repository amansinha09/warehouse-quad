## **Contributing to warehouse-quad**
___
In order to contribute please follow this guideline.

1. Make a **new branch** for the feature you wish to add.  
First make sure you've pulled the base branch.  
`git pull origin <base-branch-name>`  
`git checkout -b <new-feature-name>`
2. After ensuring that code on your branch is functioning correctly, make a **pull request** on the *base-branch*.

#### **Pull Requests**
* Try to ensure that you add one feature per pull request, that way tracking and rolling-back code would be easier.
* Make sure that the feature is working correctly.
* Try ensure that the feature implemented is not platform dependent.
